# RPATimeKeeping

## Short Summary
This is a project I did for Boston University course MET CS 669: Database Design and Implementation for Business. The agenda is to create a timekeeping system (TKS) dedicated to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Projects.

## Detailed Problem Statement
Our company’s Time Keeping System (TKS) has long been a source of frustration—an issue even our managers acknowledge. As a Business Analyst, documenting processes made this inefficiency less impactful. However, as a Project Manager, I now spend excessive time reconciling reported hours, generating timesheet reports, and even requesting team members to re-enter hours due to system errors.

The core issue is that our current TKS is designed for long-term, traditional projects, making it incompatible with the fast-paced nature of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. In RPA, we develop software bots that automate repetitive, rule-based tasks like Accounts Reconciliation, Invoice Processing, and Attendance Tracking, enabling rapid process execution with minimal human intervention. Since RPA projects typically have a quick turnaround of 4-8 weeks across multiple departments (Admin, HR, Finance, etc.), our existing system lacks the agility required to keep up. Below is a comparison of the challenges we face and the improvements an RPA-centric TKS could introduce.

### Current Challenge: RPA Projects have a quick turnaround; however, adding new projects for the current time-tracking system is a slow, bureaucratic process.
Project/Customer Managers will have the ability to create new projects directly, reducing reliance on a central administrative office that often faces backlogs. However, new customers should still require administrative approval.

### Current Challenge: Team members log tasks in a comment section instead of selecting predefined categories.
The proposed system will include predefined RPA-specific task categories (Discovery, Requirement Gathering, Development, etc.), eliminating manual effort in reviewing comments and reconciling hours. This ensures better tracking of estimated vs. actual hours.

### Current Challenge: The system frequently fails to capture hours accurately, requiring re-entry and manual adjustments.
A new system will be reliable, secure, and built to accurately capture all time-tracking data, ensuring efficiency and precision.
